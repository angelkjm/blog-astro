## How you should begin to program?

Is not easy to learn something new, and it will depends if you want learn that for working, like a hobbie or just for curiousity. But we will supose you want earn money with programming, the first tip is practice. _You need to take action now._\
First, you will need a first language for learn, If you like the design, I fully recommend you _HTML, CSS & JavaScript_, and if you want to be back-end, or you like more the logic, math or something more related to the other part of programming, I will recomend you, _PHP, Python or JavaScript as well_. You need to know in what area you want to specialize, because the best paid works are in a very very specific work. So you will need to know what you want to be, there are some interesting areas like:

- Data Science: Data analysis, AI, Stadistics, etcetera.
- Web programmer: Front-end, Back-end, SEO engineer, Cibersecurity, etcetera.
- Apps development: Videogames, Desktop apps, Mobile.
- Other works: UX/UI engineer,

If you want to earn money fast, my recomendation is be Front-end developer first, and then learn whatever you want. You need to make a great effort to reach your goals, and at the time you work, you will learn more. I recommend you this, because you need experience, more than certified education or knowledge, if you have experience working with people, customers, and solving problems you wont need a lot of technologies. Of course are necesary, but if you know how to solve a problem with logic on your mind, does not matter if you know Python and you need to solve that in JavaScript or PHP, you only need to learn some documentation, and solve it. If the big companies want only coders, the can ask to ChatGPT for their products, but they need people capable of solve problems, not able to write some code.

## Be a Fron-tend developer

Now, for be Front-end you will need, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, also a framework like _React or Angular_. And a CSS framework or library like Bootstrap, TailWind CSS or something like that. Some technologies like _Git, Github_, for the version control. And a code editor or IDE, and the best option is _Visual Studio Code_. For extras you can learn about internet, technologies like NodeJS, NPM, etcetera.

## Be a Back-end developer

Once you are a front-end you will need to be full-stack & _learn Back-end_, for that you will need a _Back-end Language_ with the respective framework, knowledge about the web; _API protocols(SOAP, API Rest), DataBases, Basic cibersecurity_, a hosting technologie(_Vercel or Netlify_) and a cloud service provider(_AWS, Azure or Google Cloud_)

### Short roadmap for working as a programmer:

#### Now you are Front-end

_It's time for look a job._

**For Back-end:**

1. Python or PHP
2. Framework Back-end
3. Relacional DataBases(SQL)
4. Vercel or Netlify
5. Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure
6. Basic cibersecurity
7. API protocols(SOAP, or API Rest)

_Now you are Full-Stack_

Here you can start learning what you like, you already had time for seeing what you like, and you also can learn 2 or 3 things at the same time.

### **Good luck with your Journey!**
