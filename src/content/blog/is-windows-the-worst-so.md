description: I'll analyze why if you are programmer, you should use Linux or Mac instead Windows.

## Price

The price should not be a problem if your hardware and software are your work tools. If you use a laptop, the price of the SO is not a problem because most of the laptops includes a SO intalled and activated. Ignoring thoose facts, if the price matter for you, a windows license is really expensive, compared to Linux which is for free, you have some paid distros, but rarely you will need it, and as well paid distros are cheaper even if you buy a OEM windows license.

Best SO based on price:

1. Linux(Free)
2. Mac (Included with the device, but really expensive)
3. Windows (Paid in some cases)

## Versatility

#### Programming

With Linux you can run most of languages, and also you have already installed in most of distros. If you are using Linux you will need to install more packages, and that cause you problems. With Mac, and Windows you are limited with the languages to use.

Best SO based programming environment:

1. Linux
2. Mac
3. Windows

#### Design

For design, Mac has the best environment, you can use your I-pad for draw, and the integratios to move files between Mac-Os is the best, you don't lose quality, you don't need a wire or a USB to move files to another device and is really fast. Also most the best design programs are available on Mac & Windows. Here Linux is the worst, but you only will need this if you work with UX/UI, you are Front-end(even if you are Front-end perhaps you won't need anything) or you are graphic designer.
Best SO based on design environment:

1. Mac
2. Windows
3. Linux

Even if linux is the worst, this point is not really important for programmers.

## Personalization

With Linux you can personalize all what you want, even if you want to create your own distro you can, but let's talk about the available SO's, Mac here is the worst, is very closed and you can't personalize more than your background. With Windows you have more options, but is not even close to the options with linux, starting on the different distros that you can use, the each distro can work with diferent desktops, different apps, you can have all your device with a color squeme, the GRUB, the lock-screen, desktop, development environment, terminal, browser, file explorer, background, all with your design and integrated. With Windows or Mac you don't have that option.

Best SO based on personalization:

1. Linux
2. Windows
3. Mac

You have a perfect distro for you, if you don't want to set all, and you want to install and start working, you have Ubuntu with a lot of desktop options. If you want to make all the configuration of your SO, you have Gentoo or Arch Linux, if you need something between both you can install Fedora or Debian. Are you hacker or you are studying cibersecurity? Use Kali Linux. You want to play videogames? perfect, install windows on dual boot, you don't want to install and set a dual boot,use a virtual machine. Linux is like Thanos, Linux is inevitable. You want a minimal design, support, and easy installation, use Zorin Os or Deepin Os.

## Performance

The performance will always depend on what are you doing, Windows is the best for games, Linux for servers, and Mac-Os is the most efficient and had the best performance in multimedia work, but if you compile aplications, or just you work with a lot of data, linux will be the best option. So here we don't have winners

## Security

Working on it!
