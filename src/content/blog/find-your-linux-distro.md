## Road map for learn Linux

Even if you want to use some very customizable distributions you will need a process of learning first. So does not matter what you want, if you are starting with Linux, you must use Debian based distros, and my recomendatios are _Ubuntu or Linux Mint_ both are for free, I don't recommend you a paid distro to starting, because you don't lose anything, even if you waste time, you will learn something. At least, you will learn how to install Linux, a basic use of the terminal, like for installing apps, or explore files.

After you learn how to use Ubuntu, if you want to use Ubuntu stay there, but make the effort to use Ubuntu flavours, like Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Mate or Ubuntu Cynammon. Only to use another desktop, but even if you want use Ubuntu I recommend you try Debian or even try a non-Debian based distro.

Linux has different package managers for different distros and the best is learn how to use more than 1. Once you learn Ubuntu and then Debian you can try Fedora, because uses RPM wich are probably the best package manager of Linux. RPM are the most stable packages of Linux, and Fedora even if it's eas to use, add some difficult to use it.

And the jump to a PacMan based distro like ArchLinux which probably are the distros were you will need more knowledge to use. After you try a variety of distros you can go to your favorite. But this is not necesary, essential is learn with Ubuntu first.

The principle distros on linux are:

1. Debian based:
   Uses dpkg package manager and .dev packages.

- Ubuntu
- Ubuntu-based
- Also have Parrot-Os, PureOs, Sparky Linux & MX Linux as famous distros based on Debian or Ubuntu.

I don't even tryed all of those, I don't like Debian, but you can learn a lot with that distros I recommend you go for Ubuntu and Debian, because you will have less problems than with other distros. And obviously am leaving out a lot of good distros, or famous distros.

2. RPM based:
   Uses RPM package manager and .rpm packages

- Red Hat Enterprise(Paid distros)
- Fedora (and Fedora based)
- Open SUSE
- Gecko Linux
- Rocky Linux
- Cent OS

SORRY! Working on it
