## First: Basic Syntaxys and types

All the languages share a syntax, and the syntax will depend on each one. Thats the first thing that you will learn, how to write that code. For example:

```python
# Python is a indented language and you don't need to mark your code, but you will need to indent code
# Python is a good example to explain types

x = 1
y = 10
name = "String"

# You can have primitive data types and you also can have composite data types

list1 = ["a", "b", 1]


```

```html
<html>
  <header>
    <title>Document</title>
  </header>
  <body>
    <p>
      Even html is not a programming language, is a good example because you
      need to mark tags of your content, and you close the tags.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Different types of data

Usually you will have differents types of data but the first you should learn are the primitive data types. Then learn if the language is dinamyc typing or statically typed, that means you can or can't change the data type during runtime. Python is dinamyc typed, that means a string can be converted in a float, int or boolean and for example C++ is statically typed and you can't change an integer to string. Usually statically typed languages are fastest than dynamic typed languages because dynamic languages save the info or the data type and valid the type constantly, and when you define a type for ever you know the type always be the same, but dynamic typed languages make faster the process of programming, and easier as well. And when you are done, you can learn composite data types, constructed by a set of primitive datatypes.
